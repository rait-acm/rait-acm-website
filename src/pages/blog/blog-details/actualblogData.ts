        What springs to your mind when you first hear the word "UNICORN" ? To me, a mere 19-year-old, unbeknown to the conventions of the corporate world, it doesn't#39;t seems to imply anything more than a white-winged steed with a horn on its forehead. Naturally, my perplexity knew no bounds when I encountered this term in the context of commerce. At first, I assumed it to be a typing error. However, when this &quot;error &quot; became more frequent, I was forced to accuse my limited familiarity with the subject rather than the publisher's grammar. And that was the moment of epiphany - my first glimpse of corporate practices.

        a labyrinth of trade, finance, commerce, and business, infused with contemporary elements of technology to conceive an empire beyond the four walls of a room. Strange, that something so complex would share its name with a creature from the fairytales. However, each unicorn or startup( as most people call it) has fulfilled dreams that even fairytales have failed to fathom. A tech startup provides technology, products, or services to the market. If it was not for TISCO, the pioneer of the Indian industrial revolution, we would not be a global technology giant today. Gone are the days when you had to slog through years of formal education to innovate and create. Today, an idea in the head and the will to stop at nothing is adequate. With 4,200 tech startups and a 40% annual startup growth rate, India is exploding as the third-largest tech startup hub in the world. The sole purpose of a tech startup is to make lives more straightforward and effortless with technology. Devising modern solutions to everyday problems. Releasing new technology or updating existing ones, improves the quality of our lives. For instance, the covid year saw an upsurge in the ed-tech industry with new online educational platforms opening up and expanding business. With people locked indoors and urgent medicinal needs to be fulfilled, Pharmeasy came to our rescue. Blind dates are a thing of the past now when we have multiple online dating platforms. And these are only a few selective instances. That day is not far from when entrepreneurship will become an attitude and not just a profession.

Back in 1990, when Tim Berners-Lee created the internet, it was seen as a new revolution.

People were awed by all the new possibilities. But there existed a group of people who were frightened. Frightened by what they thought it would turn into. They were called Luddites, and they were ridiculed and shunned for being conspiracy theory believing nut-jobs. The Luddites were scared that people would use the internet to replace social lives. They were scared the internet would further alienate antisocial people, trapping them in a circle-jerk of their own opinions.

Were they too paranoid? Or did they really see it for what it was? We started with a system to share files, which evolved to a system to communicate across the world quickly, and is now a part of every single part of our lives. The internet evolves every day, and frankly, nothing else in the world is as versatile as it is. The problem with having such a powerful tool at our disposal is, not all of us use it for good. And these problems that have risen in the modern information age are some we’ve never seen before.

Let’s be fair here, the internet has either been the source of, or an integral tool to most modern-day progress. And isn’t that why it’s so difficult to come to grips with our current reality?

The internet is now seen as an essential need. People of all ages are extremely dependent on it, especially young adults. Teens being radicalized by social media, whose algorithms only show them what they want to see, specially developed to keep people scrolling. People blame the pandemic for making the internet essential, but all it did was accelerate the pace of the inevitable. It forced us to use the internet for everything. Now, even though the pandemic is gone, we’re still dependent on the internet for basic needs—navigation, music, socializing, food, the list goes on. We’ve integrated the internet into our lives in a major way, and we might just have to accept that it is going to keep evolving the way it has, and become a much more intrusive part of our lives.

To be fair, this can be looked at as a good thing too. It is up to you, the reader, to decide. We choose to not think about it because, after all, who likes thinking and talking about unpleasant things? I chose to write about this because I’d like us to.

Our lives are infinitely better and worse because of the internet. The term “Inter-net” was coined because it was developed to help communication “inter” devices. Is it time we changed it to “Outer-net”?

Let's dive into the world of NFTs. It all began with Satoshi Nakamoto, who created the famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which is based on anonymity and decentralization. The goal was to create a currency that would be controlled by the people and for the people. The chain is typically controlled by large companies or governments, but this individual or organization had a different vision.

The introduction of Ethereum marked the next major milestone in the crypto world. This was created by Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum was a more prominent decentralized platform. As the crypto world evolved, people wanted to use these currencies to do more. This led to the creation of digital assets called NFTs—Non-Fungible Tokens. These tokens were a way for artists and other digital creators to create assets that their communities craved.

The first decentralized platform to buy and trade NFTs on was OpenSea, which is based on the Ethereum blockchain. OpenSea is the largest NFT marketplace where users can buy, sell, trade, and bid on NFTs as they are accessible to the public. For collectors, NFT artworks are better investments than real-world art since they are indestructible, on the blockchain, and cannot be stolen as they are easily traceable.

The NFT scene began with ordinary artworks by famous creators but soon became popular among ordinary people. As the NFT and crypto scene were booming, many companies tried to ride the wave and introduced perks just for owning their NFTs. Big names like Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, and VeeFriends provided their NFT holders with perks like invitations to special private events. This fostered a sense of community and exclusivity, changing the user experience of owning an NFT.

Besides the Ethereum blockchain, the Solana blockchain came into play. The developers of Solana focused on making the user experience more friendly and straightforward. Buying, selling, and trading NFTs on the Solana platform was much more hassle-free as it evaded the gas fees needed to process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. After a massive airdrop from any popular NFT studio, the traffic on trading platforms was frustrating, but the Solana blockchain NFTs thrived.

It was the time for Web 3. This included creating an outside-the-world experience by integrating NFTs into the mainstream business stream. A big highlight was Facebook changing its name to META to create a strong first-mover advantage in the METAVERSE.

The ownership of digital assets within the metaverse increases one's chances of creating a social presence on the platform. For example, owning an outfit on the blockchain will be added to your Metamask wallet, which directly links to the metaverse. This allows you to wear the same outfit in a game or simulation.

Gears or equipment such as the Oculus Quest 2 and the Valve Index are available to help users experience the METAVERSE. There are many different blockchain-based gaming platforms, but the pioneers were Decentraland and Sandbox, where users can simulate the real world virtually.

Most blockchains provide open-source frameworks, and UX and UI designers can play an important role in the METAVERSE. The possibilities are endless, as most mainstream occupations can be integrated into the METAVERSE and potentially be much more profitable than traditional methods.

There is no doubt that NFTs will continue to evolve as a topic over time. There’s a lot to say about the unexplored world of cryptocurrency—a world of learning experiences combined with the chance to make some cold hard cash!

      Building a startup can be equated to launching a spacecraft. There's a reason it's cliché.

      You must organize a skilled crew, create a machine that can fly without disintegrating, and then endeavor to reach outer space before the fuel runs out.

      Because it is impractical to assemble a complete team of professionals fairly quickly, each member wears numerous jobs.

      Startup teams must handle sales, branding, HR, management, and customer success in the initial stages, when it is unclear if the ship will fly to the moon or burst like a tragic firework. All while raising the next crucial round of investment.

      Nonetheless, as a startup beginning after so many others have experienced exhilarating success or catastrophic failure, you have a wealth of wisdom to draw from that will boost your odds of survival.

      That knowledge is disseminated over the internet in the form of where and how instructions, reports, and opinion pieces. It's there if you are willing to look, but the excellent stuff is easily drowned out in a sea of mediocrity.

      Technologies are evolving on a timely basis, and we are integrating them in response to the demands of career. Digital developments make work easier.

      Benefits of using Technology in startups:

      1. Select specialized technological solutions

      Many firms operations have been revolutionized by team collaboration software and applications. Companies are no longer need to preserve numerous document copies and spreadsheets and email them to one another in order to receive feedback from their peers. Businesses could save time by allowing multiple team members to operate on and evaluate papers at the same time via online authoring applications such as Google Docs.

      2. Staff Collaboration and Coordination

      Several businesses harness the power of social proof to engage their audience by inviting consumers to leave online evaluations. This procedure can be automated using evaluation software, which could be set up to periodically email or text customers and ask them to leave a Google review regarding their experience. This enables prospects to learn what other customers think of the business and enables the business to gain new consumers by creating trust online.

      3. Improved Storage Options

      IT infrastructure modernization helps firms to replace outdated legacy systems using cloud storage solutions. Cloud storage systems are dependable, providing for exclusive access to company information from anywhere on the planet. It allows your teams to function remotely and obtain the necessary information. It also eliminates the need to maintain large servers, saving both space and money.

      4. Increased Data Security

      Cyber attackers are more clever than ever, and a traditional security posture based solely on firewalls and antivirus software is no longer effective. Making technology a priority ensures that your data is well-protected. With cloud-based security technologies, businesses may benefit from a greater level of security.

      It is said that women are much better at communicating than men. Well, we are not here to judge anyone on their gender and race. Knowing this shouldn't lead us to have preconceptions about male or female employees, but it is a good indication that having several women in leadership positions will ultimately facilitate a healthy and communicative company culture.

      Research has shown that women want to make a difference in the world. They are keen and passionate about it. Since the tech world is the majority of men, women want to work in the tech world and set examples and become role models for other younger girls. They want to motivate and encourage young girls to enter their vast technology area, find their passion and work for it and serve this society.

      One example of this is California’s Harvey Mudd College, which put this into practice by creating computer science and engineering courses that emphasized collaboration and problem-solving. It worked; the college has since graduated majority-women engineering and computer science classes.

      Well, diversity would be an overweighed word here. But if you want your company to be in the top position, this is one of the factors one must not neglect. Diversity in thoughts helps to gain a broader vision and to think in a much smarter way. Working within a group of people who all have similar backgrounds and life experiences results in stagnation; working with people who all have a different perspective on the world will bring fresh ideas to the table, time and time again. That extends not only to women, but to people of color, LGBT men and women, and people with disabilities.

      Talking of the tech world where women are in the minority, female leadership will create an environment where the voices of the people irrespective of gender and race would be heard. This will not only give much greater ideas to the company but also give confidence and motivation to employees, increasing their efficiency and willingness to work on the projects assigned to them. This, of course, will result in increased gain and profit for the company.

      Along with the benefits it creates for a business, the benefits of gender diversity can also help employees in the workplace. Studies have shown that having a gender-diverse policy can increase positivity in the workplace. Workers feel like they can self-promote, communicate their ambitions, and are more likely to progress in their careers. Both men and women feel they benefit from gender diversity policies within an organization as they are more likely to feel that there is equal pay between genders.

      Several years ago, every small work needed a large effort, but today, every large work needs a small effort. This became possible due to development in technology, and it's cool, right? But in this universe, nothing is ideal. Everything that has advantages also has disadvantages. Like that, growing technology also has its disadvantages. The most major threat in growing technology is cyber security.

      The major question arises here: What is cyber security? In short, cyber security is the practices developed to protect computer programs, computer software, and networks from unauthorized access and cyber attacks.

      Does cyber security need to be given much importance? In today's time, we are all moving from the real world to the online world. We do most of our work online, and if online work doesn't have any security, then it’s equivalent to risking our lives. Therefore, today cyber security is also a very important factor in our day-to-day lives.

      According to Outpost, there is a 30% increase in online shopping done today, and due to this large demand for online shopping, 20 of the largest retailers in the US and Europe are targeted by cyber attacks. These retailers need to strengthen their cyber security.

      Phishing is the process of stealing sensitive data from the user forcefully without the permission of the user. Today, there is a rise of 37% in phishing due to the increasing vulnerability of programming languages and users giving unnecessary permissions to harmful websites.

      Securing emails: In today's time, emails are considered one of the most secure forms of communication. But are emails completely secure? The answer is no. Instead of that, many giant tech companies are scratching their heads to make emails completely secure. Zix, a US-based company, has introduced advanced email threat protection utilizing machines to make emails completely secure.

      Cyber Security as a Career: Cyber security is still growing as a career and is in search of talented minds. A good knowledge and talent in cyber security can be used to protect the data and information of national importance.
    
      In today’s world, we are using more electronic gadgets connected to the internet, such as mobile phones, laptops, TVs, and even vehicles. These tools are at high risk of cyber attacks, which may lead to the loss of lives, making the cyber security factor in these tools very important.

      Lagging of cyber security in our society: 
      - Today, almost 28% of top brands are attacked by cyber threats.
      - Two-thirds of top tech companies don't give cyber security training to their employees.
      - 77% of common people don’t worry about cyber security.

      A large recent incident related to cyber security:
      - Stealing of COVID-19 vaccine information among countries: Today, the vaccine has become the most important factor to win the battle against COVID-19. The information for the production of the COVID-19 vaccine is stored in supercomputers. This information, stored by many large countries, was hacked by many hackers around the world.
    
      Tormod Ree, CEO of AVA Security, commented that the only way to protect against hybrid cyber and physical security is to have a solution that can connect the dots across both domains, that is, end-to-end encryption.

      By keeping the above disastrous factors in mind, there are many steps being taken to strengthen cyber security:
      - Core Light introduces its new software sensor to take internet security to the next level.

Python showed incredible growth, especially in countries with high capital, and most of the developers prefer Python over any other programming language. One of the main reasons for Python's popularity is the leverage that Python provides through its libraries and frameworks. As Python has a huge community, it has excellent open-source libraries. According to a GitHub report, there are 3,61,832 developers and contributors supporting almost more than 2,50,000 packages of Python.

Tech-Globalization has its impacts on both the public and private sectors. It has helped beat import barriers, lack of common ethical standards, transportation costs, and delays in information exchange, thereby changing the marketplace.

      Let’s look at six major factors affecting the global economy:
      
      1. **Time-saving and Cost-efficient**: 
      With increased competition, companies are lowering manufacturing costs significantly. Due to global connections, companies can find the least expensive suppliers, providing consumers with good quality and cheap goods. Technological advancements have allowed technicians to control robotic systems, which can operate an entire manufacturing plant.
      
      2. **E-commerce**: 
      Manufacturing and commodity companies have developed online links to their suppliers and customer support. Automated systems enable suppliers to track production and ship materials, ensuring quality and fast delivery. Banking advancements such as NEFT, RTGS, and IMPS have made fund transfers easier on a global scale.

      3. **Job Opportunities**: 
      Technological advancements have increased job opportunities and strengthened economic growth. It has enabled software experts to collaborate with companies worldwide, contributing to the growth of the global market.
      
      4. **Smooth Trade and Transportation**: 
      Technology has allowed businesses to expand globally. Manufacturers can choose the most profitable company offering the lowest cost, without compromising quality. GPS systems, cellular and Wi-Fi signals, satellite tracking, and other innovations have revolutionized the way we travel.

      5. **Education Industry**: 
      The internet keeps us connected globally, providing access to information anytime. Telecommunication advancements have made data exchange possible worldwide. Distance education has also made learning accessible to students who can’t afford to move to other cities or countries, thus contributing to the global economy.

      6. **Labour Class**: 
      Technological progress has increased the demand for skilled workers and reduced the demand for routine manual labor. Automation is driving the global economy forward, though it has led to job displacement for some laborers.

      **What is edge computing?**

      Edge computing is a distributed, open IT architecture featuring decentralized processing power, enabling mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. It allows data from IoT devices to be analyzed at the edge of the network before being sent to a data center or cloud.

      In edge computing, the data is locally managed, stored, processed, and analyzed. Unlike cloud computing where data is sent to a centralized data-processing warehouse, edge computing processes data on-site. This reduces bandwidth needs as only relevant data is sent to the cloud.

      Devices such as IoT sensors, security cameras, and smartphones act as edge devices that process data locally. By moving computation to the network edge, edge computing minimizes the need for long-distance communication between client and server.

      **How is edge different from cloud?**

      In cloud computing, data is sent to the cloud and retrieved when needed, which creates latency due to the distance between the client and server. The data obtained is not always accurate because of this delay.

      Edge computing is a part of cloud computing but focuses on bringing data processing closer to the devices. This reduces latency and allows for real-time data retrieval. For example, CCTV cameras send live footage to the cloud, but the quality of the data can degrade. With edge computing, real-time, high-quality information can be processed and used.

      Latency can lead to safety hazards, especially in autonomous vehicles, which must react to danger signals instantly. Cloud computing takes about 100 milliseconds for data transmission, which can have negative effects. Edge computing can speed up data retrieval and enable real-time reactions, minimizing latency.

      **5G and Edge Computing**: 
      5G will help accelerate edge computing by offering faster speeds and incorporating edge-computing strategies into deployments. This will enable real-time processing, especially for mobile devices, connected cars, and self-driving cars.

      **Reduced costs**: 
      Edge computing reduces bandwidth use and server resources, helping to cut down on costs. IoT devices, like smart cameras and printers, will be supported by edge computing in the future as their numbers increase.

      **Privacy**: 
      There are cybersecurity concerns with edge computing. Hackers may manipulate devices to alter collected data. Therefore, edge-powered devices must be physically secured to protect the data stored within them.

      Edge computing is expected to grow rapidly and have a significant impact on the enterprise world, similar to how smartphones revolutionized consumer computing. With advancements in AI and 5G technologies, and growing demands for smart industrial IoT applications, edge computing may reach maturity faster than anticipated. By 2025, 75% of companies are expected to adopt edge computing.
