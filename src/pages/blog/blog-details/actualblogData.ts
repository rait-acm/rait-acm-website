        What springs to your mind when you first hear the word "UNICORN" ? To me, a mere 19-year-old, unbeknown to the conventions of the corporate world, it doesn't#39;t seems to imply anything more than a white-winged steed with a horn on its forehead. Naturally, my perplexity knew no bounds when I encountered this term in the context of commerce. At first, I assumed it to be a typing error. However, when this &quot;error &quot; became more frequent, I was forced to accuse my limited familiarity with the subject rather than the publisher's grammar. And that was the moment of epiphany - my first glimpse of corporate practices.

        a labyrinth of trade, finance, commerce, and business, infused with contemporary elements of technology to conceive an empire beyond the four walls of a room. Strange, that something so complex would share its name with a creature from the fairytales. However, each unicorn or startup( as most people call it) has fulfilled dreams that even fairytales have failed to fathom. A tech startup provides technology, products, or services to the market. If it was not for TISCO, the pioneer of the Indian industrial revolution, we would not be a global technology giant today. Gone are the days when you had to slog through years of formal education to innovate and create. Today, an idea in the head and the will to stop at nothing is adequate. With 4,200 tech startups and a 40% annual startup growth rate, India is exploding as the third-largest tech startup hub in the world. The sole purpose of a tech startup is to make lives more straightforward and effortless with technology. Devising modern solutions to everyday problems. Releasing new technology or updating existing ones, improves the quality of our lives. For instance, the covid year saw an upsurge in the ed-tech industry with new online educational platforms opening up and expanding business. With people locked indoors and urgent medicinal needs to be fulfilled, Pharmeasy came to our rescue. Blind dates are a thing of the past now when we have multiple online dating platforms. And these are only a few selective instances. That day is not far from when entrepreneurship will become an attitude and not just a profession.

Back in 1990, when Tim Berners-Lee created the internet, it was seen as a new revolution.

People were awed by all the new possibilities. But there existed a group of people who were frightened. Frightened by what they thought it would turn into. They were called Luddites, and they were ridiculed and shunned for being conspiracy theory believing nut-jobs. The Luddites were scared that people would use the internet to replace social lives. They were scared the internet would further alienate antisocial people, trapping them in a circle-jerk of their own opinions.

Were they too paranoid? Or did they really see it for what it was? We started with a system to share files, which evolved to a system to communicate across the world quickly, and is now a part of every single part of our lives. The internet evolves every day, and frankly, nothing else in the world is as versatile as it is. The problem with having such a powerful tool at our disposal is, not all of us use it for good. And these problems that have risen in the modern information age are some we’ve never seen before.

Let’s be fair here, the internet has either been the source of, or an integral tool to most modern-day progress. And isn’t that why it’s so difficult to come to grips with our current reality?

The internet is now seen as an essential need. People of all ages are extremely dependent on it, especially young adults. Teens being radicalized by social media, whose algorithms only show them what they want to see, specially developed to keep people scrolling. People blame the pandemic for making the internet essential, but all it did was accelerate the pace of the inevitable. It forced us to use the internet for everything. Now, even though the pandemic is gone, we’re still dependent on the internet for basic needs—navigation, music, socializing, food, the list goes on. We’ve integrated the internet into our lives in a major way, and we might just have to accept that it is going to keep evolving the way it has, and become a much more intrusive part of our lives.

To be fair, this can be looked at as a good thing too. It is up to you, the reader, to decide. We choose to not think about it because, after all, who likes thinking and talking about unpleasant things? I chose to write about this because I’d like us to.

Our lives are infinitely better and worse because of the internet. The term “Inter-net” was coined because it was developed to help communication “inter” devices. Is it time we changed it to “Outer-net”?

Let's dive into the world of NFTs. It all began with Satoshi Nakamoto, who created the famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which is based on anonymity and decentralization. The goal was to create a currency that would be controlled by the people and for the people. The chain is typically controlled by large companies or governments, but this individual or organization had a different vision.

The introduction of Ethereum marked the next major milestone in the crypto world. This was created by Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum was a more prominent decentralized platform. As the crypto world evolved, people wanted to use these currencies to do more. This led to the creation of digital assets called NFTs—Non-Fungible Tokens. These tokens were a way for artists and other digital creators to create assets that their communities craved.

The first decentralized platform to buy and trade NFTs on was OpenSea, which is based on the Ethereum blockchain. OpenSea is the largest NFT marketplace where users can buy, sell, trade, and bid on NFTs as they are accessible to the public. For collectors, NFT artworks are better investments than real-world art since they are indestructible, on the blockchain, and cannot be stolen as they are easily traceable.

The NFT scene began with ordinary artworks by famous creators but soon became popular among ordinary people. As the NFT and crypto scene were booming, many companies tried to ride the wave and introduced perks just for owning their NFTs. Big names like Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, and VeeFriends provided their NFT holders with perks like invitations to special private events. This fostered a sense of community and exclusivity, changing the user experience of owning an NFT.

Besides the Ethereum blockchain, the Solana blockchain came into play. The developers of Solana focused on making the user experience more friendly and straightforward. Buying, selling, and trading NFTs on the Solana platform was much more hassle-free as it evaded the gas fees needed to process transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. After a massive airdrop from any popular NFT studio, the traffic on trading platforms was frustrating, but the Solana blockchain NFTs thrived.

It was the time for Web 3. This included creating an outside-the-world experience by integrating NFTs into the mainstream business stream. A big highlight was Facebook changing its name to META to create a strong first-mover advantage in the METAVERSE.

The ownership of digital assets within the metaverse increases one's chances of creating a social presence on the platform. For example, owning an outfit on the blockchain will be added to your Metamask wallet, which directly links to the metaverse. This allows you to wear the same outfit in a game or simulation.

Gears or equipment such as the Oculus Quest 2 and the Valve Index are available to help users experience the METAVERSE. There are many different blockchain-based gaming platforms, but the pioneers were Decentraland and Sandbox, where users can simulate the real world virtually.

Most blockchains provide open-source frameworks, and UX and UI designers can play an important role in the METAVERSE. The possibilities are endless, as most mainstream occupations can be integrated into the METAVERSE and potentially be much more profitable than traditional methods.

There is no doubt that NFTs will continue to evolve as a topic over time. There’s a lot to say about the unexplored world of cryptocurrency—a world of learning experiences combined with the chance to make some cold hard cash!
